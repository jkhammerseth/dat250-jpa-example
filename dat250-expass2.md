## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

### Report
Followed the jpa tutorial in experiment 1, which gave a basic understanding of JPA. 

In experiment 2 I had some issues but managed to resolve them. The main problem i had was sqlErrors but those were fixed by deleting the db folder in the project. I also had i misunderstanding and ran main.main before running the tests which resulted in some errors.

After awhile I got up to speed and the test passed. Im not sure if the tests show in github because i had some issues with commiting via intellij.
